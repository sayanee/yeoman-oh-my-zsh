#Yeoman plugin for Oh My ZSH

This is a [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) plugin for [Oh My ZSH](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) with command line aliases and zsh autocomplete functions.

##Installation

1. In the command line, navigate to the folder:

    ```
    cd ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/
    ```
2. Clone the repository into a new folder called `yeoman`:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/sayanee/yeoman-oh-my-zsh.git yeoman
    ```
3. Include `yeoman` plugin to your `.zshrc` file along with other plugins:
    
    ```
    ...
    plugins=(git nanoc yeoman)
    ...
    ```

4. For changes to take effect, reload your shell environnement by running :

    ```
    . ~/.zshrc
    ```

5. New version use the `yo` command (see [Command conversions](https://github.com/yeoman/yeoman/wiki/Migrate-from-0.9.6-to-1.0#command-conversions)), a solution to keep compatibility is to create a simlink :

    ```
    ln -s $(which yo) /usr/local/bin/yeoman # sudo maybe needed
    ```

##Features

    ```
    alias ymget='curl -L get.yeoman.io | bash'
